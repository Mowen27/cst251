    <h2>Challeges</h2>
	<p>In this lab, we are playing with more CSS customization tools, like shadows and gradients.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>We ran into issues with making some of the CSS do what we intended, but we were able to reslove these issues together.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Both my partner and I were able to execute these new tools</p>
