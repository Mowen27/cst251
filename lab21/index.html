    <h1>Lab 21: 2nd Draft Team Project Sketches</h1>
    <h2>Challeges</h2>
	<p>In this lab, we are individially refining our sketches with the feedback we recieved from our teamates.</p>
    <h2>Problems and feedback</h2>
	<p>I didn't encounter many challenges, I had a vivid idea how i wanted to refine the sketches. My team liked my skecthes that included a side bar serving as a navagation tool. I plan on expanding further with this feedback.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I was able to produce these drafts.</p>
