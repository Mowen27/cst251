    <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
    <p>The goal of this lab was to introduce file organizazion and how to link
      other local files to an html file.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I found creating the html files somewhat easy, i did find trouble with
        linking my image to the file. It kept appearing sideways on the web,
        so i have to edit it within Illustrator to fix it.
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>My file structure appears as follows.</p>
